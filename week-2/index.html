         <p> to visualise the spiral in 3d space. </p>
         <br></br> <p2> </p2> <br> </br>
         <p> by twisting the spiral through the paper this way, </p>
         <p>i found that i did not like how it moved around the paper with the center of the spiral now remaining in the center of the paper/screen.</p>

                  <p> code workspace</p>
                  <br></br>
                  <p> seperate folder for testing and experimentation using 3d elements in three.js and then aframe. </p>
                  <br></br> <p2> </p2> <br> </br>
                  <p> inspired by the 3d websites i previously found, i wanted to make my own.</p>
                  <p> i was recomended to use aframe for creating vr spaces, so i started learning. </p>
                  <p> i created this scene by creating custom octahedrons and then rotating them in the scene.</p>

                  <p> outcome</p>
                  <br></br>
                  <p>  i found that the initial concept i had for this workbook was too complex to create in 3d space and submit in time.</p>
                  <br></br> <p2> </p2> <br> </br>
                  <p> i ran into many problems with my instances of three.js and aframe that held me back for quite some time. </p>
                  <p> this meant reimagining the spiral concept, resulting in increasing the amount of spirals to get a hypnotising effect.  </p>

        <p3> restyling the website by strengthening grid, adjusting palette and sizing.</p3>
        <p3> this is a test of the new grid system, this has taken a lot of time.</p3>
        
        <p4> firstly, i removed the top navbar.</p4>
        <p3> as said in the feedback, it was not working well within the site. </p3> 
        <p3>the sizing of the back button and the page title were mismatched. </p3>
        <p3> i wanted the new menu to extend from the bottom up, like a plant growing.</p3>
        <h1>~</h1>
        <p4> &#32;</p4>
        <p4> i have adjusted the palette to make it less harsh in areas to improve readability. </p4>
        <p3> to make the site seem less erratic, i have changed some colours that were contrasting too much or not working. </p3>
        <p3> i have also changed the sizing of the text and buttons to make them more readable. </p3>
        <p3> the text colour has now been changed to a lighter blue colour, rather than the sandy orange it was before. </p3>
        <h1>~</h1>
        <p4> &#32;</p4>
        <p4> this new grid system allows me to create seperate items that can start and end at the different columns and rows. </p4>
        <p3> This allows me to create a more dynamic layout, that is more effective as the text can now be nested in different containers. </p3>
        <h1>~</h1>

        <div class="item item3"> 
          <p4> adapted from in-class demo, </p4>
          <p3> adjusted for webpage integration assisted by gemini. </p3>
          <p3> this has helped greatly for structuring my code in a functioning way as it uses the p5.js instance mode, also for troubleshooting for flexability. </p3>

            <p3> last year i took the word as image in space & time subject, in this we created sketches in processing.</p3>
            <p4> to refamiliarise myself, i looked back at my previous work. </p4>
            <p4> we were tasked to create a monogram and self-portrait</p4>
            <p3> i created a simple monogram, but took one of the in-class demos further to create a drawing tool that uses type.</p3>

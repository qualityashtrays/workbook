            <p3> fun sketch testing out the sound add on for processing.</p3>
            <p4> this was also a demo for using the input mic level as a parameter, to create a visualiser that rotates text that is typed.</p4>
            
            <p4> i have had a bit of trouble with this sketch, mostly due to the file paths and file types i believe.</p4>
            <p3> adjusting this for this workbook has brought up more problems, as usual. </p3>
            <p3> i have double checked the paths and made sure i have the libraries imported, but so far it is not working as intended.</p3>

      <h1> ~ john whitney</h1>
      <p3> i have been looking at whitney's works frequently for inspiration. i find his work hypnotising, with the movement and colours he uses.</p3>
      <p4> often the simple soundtracks are potentially more effective, as the lower intensity draws our focus to the graphics, but keeps the viewers attention. </p4>

      <h1> ~ </h1>
      <p3> I have learnt a lot from developing this website so far, with many hours spent trying to get everything to work together. </p3>
      <p3> even with the help of ai chat models, there are some aspects that i have not been able to solve.</p3>
      <p4> </p4>
      <h1> ~ </h1>
      <p3> i have also learnt a lot about the processing library, and how to use it to create interactive sketches.</p3>
      <p3> it has been good to refresh my p5 understanding, and to be thinking critically about how to create images and geometries digitally.</p3>
      <p4> the biggest problem i have had, has been due to the multiple different languages and coding environments we have been using. as i am still learning, i am yet to nail the nuances of integrating everything together. </p4>

      <h1> ~ </h1>
      <p3> i have found it very rewarding working with the aframe and three libraries/frameworks for javascript, especially in helping me to bring my ideas of geometries to life.</p3>

        <h1> ~ </h1>
        <p3> this project has been quite time consuming, particularly in attempting to strengthen the grid system. </p3>
        <p3> i have found that this new grid system is more flexible and provides a solid foundation for all my elements.</p3>
        <p3> moving forward i would like to change the page layouts to give the website more variation between the weeks. </p3>
        <p3> </p3>
        <h1> ~ </h1>
        <p3> the removal of the top navigation bar was good feeback from the first part of the project.</p3>
        <p3> i have found that this new menu looks better and aligns to the 'branching tree' symbology of webpages/ data visualisation</p3>
        <h1> ~ </h1>
        <p4> i have restricted the colour palette to be less eratic, although i have intentionally used bright, high-contrast colours.</p4>
        <p3> this is to reflect the high contrast of the code workspace and the digital environment.</p3>
        <h1> ~ </h1>
        <p3> i have been working to improve my time allocation, focusing on the must-do's for the website.</p3>
        <p3> the updated grid system took me quite a bit of time to figure out and get to a working point.</p3>
        <p3> everything is expanding and developing, the more i learn,, the more i realise how trapped we are. as slaves to the algorithm and machines.. thats okay</p3>
